# Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations

## Overview

In the hospitality industry, the frequent occurrence of booking cancellations, particularly with the widespread offer of no-deposit bookings, poses significant challenges. These cancellations lead to substantial financial losses and operational inefficiencies for hotels. This project aims to address this issue by developing machine learning models to predict potential booking cancellations. By identifying bookings with a high probability of being canceled, hotels can take proactive measures to mitigate revenue losses, improve demand forecasting, refine their overbooking and cancellation policies, and optimize pricing and inventory management. Additionally, this analysis can help hotels recognize loyal customers who seldom cancel, allowing for more personalized service offerings.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to forecast the likelihood of a hotel booking being canceled. The machine learning models analyze various features and trends associated with bookings to flag those that are at high risk of cancellation. With these insights, hotels can take preemptive actions, reducing the impact on their bottom line. This predictive capability not only enhances demand forecasting accuracy but also enables more effective management of overbooking policies and pricing strategies.

## Dataset

I utilized the **Hotel Booking Demand** dataset from Kaggle for this project. This dataset includes detailed booking information for both city and resort hotels, covering factors such as booking date, duration of stay, the number of guests, parking availability, and more. Personal identifiers have been removed to ensure privacy. The dataset originates from the study *Hotel Booking Demand Datasets* by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes, published in *Data in Brief*, Volume 22, February 2019.

## Libraries and Tools

The project is implemented using the following libraries:

- **Python Standard Library**: Core Python modules.
- **Numpy**: Numerical computing library.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for static and dynamic plots.
- **Seaborn**: High-level visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **PySpark**: Python API for Apache Spark, used for large-scale data processing and machine learning.
